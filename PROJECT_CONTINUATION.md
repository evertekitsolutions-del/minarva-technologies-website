# Minarva Technologies — Project Continuation Source of Truth

## Project identity

This repository is for **Minarva Technologies' own business website + internal business operations system**.

It is **not** the separate commercial product **Minarva Biz**.

The goal is one connected system for Minarva Technologies covering:
- Public website
- Enquiry capture
- Admin CRM
- Customer management
- Quotations
- Billing / invoices
- Payments
- Service jobs / tickets
- Computer & CCTV service workflow
- Product/service catalogue
- Purchases / expenses where needed
- Reports
- Customer follow-up and reminders
- Future customer self-service / portal

## Delivery rules

- Continue from live GitHub/Supabase state; do not restart finished work.
- Work in **small, fully completed milestones**.
- Do not simplify away required features.
- Root-cause fix blockers rather than removing features.
- Prefer free architecture while the business is still scaling.
- Keep public website and internal admin system connected but security-separated.
- Use RLS on exposed Supabase tables.
- Never expose service-role secrets in browser code.
- Preserve existing public website and CRM behavior while adding billing/operations.

- PDF/print-ready document output later in the phase
- Convert enquiry → quotation
- Convert quotation → invoice
- Audit timestamps and authorized admin access

### Phase B — Service operations
- Service job / ticket creation
- CCTV service workflow
- Computer/laptop service workflow
- Customer device/site details
- Complaint / diagnosis / work performed
- Technician assignment
- Parts/material usage
- Job status
- Follow-up / completion
- Service history
- Link service job → invoice

### Phase C — Purchases / expenses / inventory support
Only what Minarva Technologies needs operationally:

- Expenses
- Basic profitability/reporting links

### Phase D — Customer experience
- Customer portal or secure document access
- Quote/invoice/service-status view
- Payment status

### Phase E — Reporting / automation

## Immediate next milestone

**Billing Foundation — Milestone 1**

Create secure Supabase schema for:
- business billing settings
- customers
- catalogue items/services
- quotations
- quotation items

Requirements:
- RLS from day one
- Admin-only management
- GST fields optional
- No fake production data
- Existing enquiries remain untouched
- Design conversion path from enquiry → customer → quotation
- Run security/performance advisors after migration

After this milestone is verified, add the first Billing/Quotations section to the existing admin UI.
